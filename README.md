# Drivers-Drowsiness-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Design and develop an advanced Driver Drowsiness Detection System utilizing deep learning techniques to analyze facial features and detect fatigue. The system will be trained on labeled images/video frames to identify signs of drowsiness
Here we are using deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) for video analysis, and Transfer Learning for better accuracy.

# Approach
1. **CNN for Image-Based Drowsiness Detection:** Train a CNN to classify drowsiness from static images (frames extracted from videos).
2. **LSTM for Video-Based Drowsiness Detection:** Use LSTMs to capture temporal dependencies from sequences of frames.
3. **Transfer Learning: Use a pre-trained model** (such as VGG16, ResNet50, etc.) and fine-tune it for drowsiness detection.
